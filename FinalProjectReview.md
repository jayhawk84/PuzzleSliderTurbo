# PuzzleSliderTurbo
This is a web-based version of a classic sliding puzzle game.

## Project Experience
I enjoyed a few moments during this semester long project.  To be perfectly honest, it was more stressful than anything.  The coursework throughout MSSA was
overloaded throughout every single week except the last two.  This project ended up being more of an afterthought than a primary focus.  I am not particularly happy 
that ended up being the case.  I think the project is a lot more important to our development as software engineers, but it's hard to prioritize many weekends when the
project is only one assingment out of 20.  Not only that, but the course curriculum itself doesn't come into focus until well after the midway point of MSSA.  This project
"starts" in the beginning of the curriculum, and I do not feel like that is an appropriate point in time to conceptualize and finalize an idea.  That is why halfway through
MSSA I actually scrapped my initial project and went with the Puzzle Sliding game.

## What I learned
#### What I feel like I did right?
I like the title of my project...  I think the bootstrap layout for everything but the tiles works well.

#### What I did wrong?  I did not introduce enough dynamic elements in this project.  Every time I am away from my computer and I think about the project, I have ideas about how
I could do that, but I did not implement them as I wanted, sadly.  If I can work on it more after MSSA, that would be my goal, to remove all the hard coded elements I can.

#### Where was I lucky?
I don't feel like I lucked out on this project at all, so I'll just share a life example with you all.  I worked for a sum total of two days with my girlfriend, who was a
temporary assignment at my store.  I asked for her number the first day I saw her, and on the second day she worked there, asked her out.  She never worked there again, but
we've been going out for three years now.  I got really lucky that day, so I'm ok if my luck supply takes a while to replenish.

#### What would I change?
I wish I had known at the beginning that most of what we learn here in SQL will not pertain to the project.  I did want to make something that used a database (because my puzzle 
does not really require one at all) but I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get the Azure/SQL connection to work very well.  After going through some of the Labs later in 
the MSSA course, I realized it was much simpler than I anticipated.  Really, I think if half of the homework/assignments were discarded, and this project were allowed more space
in the assignments, that some of us might be less anxious and more prepared to really dive into it.
